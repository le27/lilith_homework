For one week try to use the terminal to do absolutely everything in your system including changing wifi 
networks. You dont have to do it to open .desktop files (if you don't know what those are or where they are 
figure it out). (3)



*Install Arch on a VM (5)

Make a bash script automating all the tasks in this guide that runs periodically (the suggested frequencies 
in the link). 
Set this script to run as a background process every time your system boots and have it check for the amount of 
time passed since the last update for each activity. Upload the final project to github and send it to me. (4)

On EndeavourOS (use timeshift to save your system before attempting) install a different desktop environment 
and switch to it. Gnome or XFCE or Cinammon (2)

Install and run a window manager like Hyprland, AwesomeWM, I3, sway. Follow whatever guide there is to setting
 it up and configuring it online. (4)

Write me a report inside your terminal as a markdown file listing each directory in YOUR root (/) and tell me 
what each folder contains and why it's named the way it is. (3)

To summarize, this is a four-part process:

Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md 
or .markdown extension.
Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.
Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format,
 like PDF.


++Download the repo and build this AUR package from source. Use of yay is not allowed but if you can install 
another AUR Helper I will give you partial credit. (3)

+++Pick out applications that you like from this list and replace your current loadout of applications with ones
